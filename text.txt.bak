Born to middle-class Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants in {@from id:"chom"}Philadelphia, Chomsky
developed an early interest in anarchism from alternative bookstores in {@via wc:"3" id:"chom"}New
York City. At the age of sixteen he began studies at the {@via id:"chom" wc:"3"}University of
Pennsylvania, taking courses in linguistics, mathematics, and philosophy.
From 1951 to 1955 he was appointed to {@via id:"chom" wc:"2" date:"1951/1955"}Harvard University's Society of
Fellows, where he developed the theory of transformational grammar for which
he was awarded his doctorate in 1955. That year he began teaching at {@ date:"1955"}MIT, in
1957 emerging as a significant figure in the field of linguistics for his
landmark work Syntactic Structures, which remodeled the scientific study of
language, while from 1958 to 1959 he was a National Science Foundation
fellow at the {@to id:"chom" wc:"4" date:"1958/1959"}Institute for Advanced Study. He is credited as the creator or
co-creator of the universal grammar theory, the generative grammar theory,
the Chomsky hierarchy, and the minimalist program. Chomsky also played a
pivotal role in the decline of behaviorism, being particularly critical of
the work of B. F. Skinner.
